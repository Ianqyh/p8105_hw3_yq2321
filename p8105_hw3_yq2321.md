## Problem 1

``` r
data("instacart")
```

The “instacart” dataset contains 1384617 obsevations in total and each
row in the dataset represents a product from an order. There are 15
variables in this dataset. The order\_id variable is the order
identifier. The product\_id variable is the product identifier. The
add\_to cart\_order variable represents the order in which each product
was added to cart. The reordered variable is 1 if this prodcut has been
ordered by this user in the past and 0 otherwise. The user\_id variable
is the customer identifier. The eval\_set variable represents which
evaluation set this order belongs in. The order\_number variable is the
order sequence number for this user (1 = first, n = nth). The order\_dow
variable represents the day of the week on which the order was placed.
The order\_hour\_of\_day variable is the hour of the day on which the
order was placed. The days\_since\_prior\_order represents days since
the last order, capped at 30, NA if order\_number = 1. The product\_name
variable is the name of the product. The aisle\_id variable is the aisle
identifier. The department\_id variable is the department identifier.
The aisle variable represents the name of the aisle the product is in.
The department variable represents the name of the department the
product is in.

``` r
instacart %>%
  group_by(aisle) %>%
  summarize(total = n()) %>%
  arrange(desc(total))
```

    ## # A tibble: 134 × 2
    ##    aisle                          total
    ##    <chr>                          <int>
    ##  1 fresh vegetables              150609
    ##  2 fresh fruits                  150473
    ##  3 packaged vegetables fruits     78493
    ##  4 yogurt                         55240
    ##  5 packaged cheese                41699
    ##  6 water seltzer sparkling water  36617
    ##  7 milk                           32644
    ##  8 chips pretzels                 31269
    ##  9 soy lactosefree                26240
    ## 10 bread                          23635
    ## # … with 124 more rows

From the table above, we can see that there are 134 aisles and the top
10 aisles that most items are ordered from include fresh vegetables,
fresh fruits, packaged vegetable fruits, yogurt, packaged cheese, water
seltzer sparkling water, milk, chips pretzels, soy lactosefree, and
bread.

``` r
instacart %>%
  group_by(aisle) %>%
  summarize(total = n()) %>%
  arrange(desc(total)) %>%
  filter(total > 10000) %>%
  mutate(aisle = fct_reorder(aisle, total)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = total, y = aisle)) + geom_point() + labs(title = "Top 39 Aisles With Most Items Ordered", xlab = "Number of items", ylab = "Aisle") + scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(from = 0, to = 160000, by = 20000))
```

The plot above shows the number of items ordered in each aisle.

``` r
instacart %>%
  filter(aisle %in% c("baking ingredients", "dog food care", "packaged vegetables fruits")) %>%
  group_by(aisle, product_name) %>%
  summarize(order_times = n()) %>%
  arrange(desc(order_times)) %>%
  mutate(rank = min_rank(desc(order_times))) %>%
  filter(rank <= 3) %>%
  knitr::kable()
```

    ## `summarise()` has grouped output by 'aisle'. You can override using the `.groups` argument.

| aisle                      | product\_name                                 | order\_times | rank |
|:---------------------------|:----------------------------------------------|-------------:|-----:|
| packaged vegetables fruits | Organic Baby Spinach                          |         9784 |    1 |
| packaged vegetables fruits | Organic Raspberries                           |         5546 |    2 |
| packaged vegetables fruits | Organic Blueberries                           |         4966 |    3 |
| baking ingredients         | Light Brown Sugar                             |          499 |    1 |
| baking ingredients         | Pure Baking Soda                              |          387 |    2 |
| baking ingredients         | Cane Sugar                                    |          336 |    3 |
| dog food care              | Snack Sticks Chicken & Rice Recipe Dog Treats |           30 |    1 |
| dog food care              | Organix Chicken & Brown Rice Recipe           |           28 |    2 |
| dog food care              | Small Dog Biscuits                            |           26 |    3 |

The table above shows the three most popular items in each of the aisles
“baking ingredients”, “dog food care”, and “packaged vegetables along
with the number of times ordered.
